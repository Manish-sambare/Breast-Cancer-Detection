# Breast Cancer Prediction ðŸ©º

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a binary classification model to detect breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to classify tumors as either malignant or benign using a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- **Features**: 30 numeric features representing cell characteristics.
- **Target**: Diagnosis label (`M` for Malignant and `B` for Benign).

## Workflow
### Data Preprocessing
- Dropped unnecessary columns.
- Mapped categorical values to numerical labels.
- Normalized the feature values for consistent input to the model.

### Model Training
- Utilized SGD Classifier for binary classification.
- Trained and validated the model using an 80-20 train-test split.

### Evaluation
- Achieved an **accuracy of 92%**.
- Evaluated using precision, recall, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Key Libraries Used
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   - Open the `Breast_Cancer.ipynb` file and execute the cells sequentially.

## Results
The model successfully classifies breast cancer cases with high accuracy, making it a promising approach for early-stage detection.
